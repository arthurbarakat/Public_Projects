This project is the result of my main research paper, which is currently under submission.

In this project, we show that we can train an algorithm, called XGBoost, to predict the number of mental high effort (MHE), and the sensitivity to mental effort (kEm).

The data used are metabolites acquired in the brain in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and anterior insula (AI).

After preparing the datasets, we initialize the algorithm and used to package, hyperopt and SHAP. Hyperopt helps us select optimal hyperparameters and SHAP plots to better understand XGBOOST results

This result is mainly focused on the effort perception of the mental part of our experiment, and not the physical part.

Finally, we show that with just 3 metabolites, we can still build a strong algorithm, highlighting the crucial role of three molecules: aspartate, lactate and glutamate.
