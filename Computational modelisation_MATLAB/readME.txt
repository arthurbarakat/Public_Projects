In this project, I present a script meant to perform computational modelling using bayesian technics.

The script extract data from a private server, shape them in a format, prepares options and apply the VBA toolbox (https://mbb-team.github.io/VBA-toolbox/). It then
proposes multiple plot options, comparing the modelisation to the actual data to understand it's accuracy.

The functions used for VBA are g_observation, according to the named definition in the VBA toolbox. Each one represent a specific model.The ones listed are the ones presented in a research paper.
