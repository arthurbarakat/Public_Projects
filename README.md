DISCLAIMER: Almost all of my work cannot be shown online as they possess sentisitive content or belong to my previous employer.

In this repository, you will find examples of projects I worked on. Most of these codes come from research already or being published, and thus are available.

I added examples I worked on in 3 languages, Python, MATLAB and R.

1) In the first python project, you can find my main project, where I develop an ML algorithm to predict motivation, as a notebook so that you can even see the results.
2) As a second python project, I added a deep learning project where I created a Noise2Noise algorithm to learn the noise pattern in an image and remove it.
3) As a first MATLAB project, I designed a script performing computational modelling of human behavior, showing how to initialize it, prepare the data and compare the results between different models.
4) As a second MATLAB project, I automated the statistical analysis, as I had hundred of test to perform in my work. In this project you will find a function that automatically performs the correct statistical analysis depending on the input data
5) Finally, the R project is a script showing how you can perform a path analysis, with different possible models.


While these projects are but a fraction of my work, it should help you make an opinion on my abilities.

Kind regards,
Arthur Barakat
