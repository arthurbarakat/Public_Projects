In this project, I created stat_test, a function which automatically perform the appropriate statistical analysis depending on the data given as an input and checks for significance, sending you back the results.

It will check for homoedasticity
It will check for normality
It will check how many group you have and perform the correct analysis.

As some statistical tests do not exist on MATLAB, swtest and wanova are function which have been proposed online to peform such computation and are thus included in this project.
