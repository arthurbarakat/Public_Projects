These results are an example of a path analysis which can be seen in our research paper : https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-024-02726-y

In this project, I conducted path analysis to extend our results further than basic mediation analysis.

I load the libraries, and propose several models of path analysis, to be tested individually. We then fit the path analysis and estimate it's performance.
